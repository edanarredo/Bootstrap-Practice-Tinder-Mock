TinDog

This is a responsive portfolio website that could be used for a startup whose product/services are delivered primarily through a mobile application (no need for a complex website).

This is supposed to be a mock-up of the real service Tinder.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4

You can view a deployment of the website here: https://edanarredo.github.io/Tinder-Website-Mockup/
